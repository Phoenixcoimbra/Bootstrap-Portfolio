# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Igor Coimbra's Portfolio using Bootstrap.


## Description

The motivation behind this project was to showcase my skills using Boostrap to produce a webpage with HTML and CSS.
This project will show that it is possible to take some code from the Boostrap and use it to make a Webpage in a reduced time, without having to code it from scratch.
